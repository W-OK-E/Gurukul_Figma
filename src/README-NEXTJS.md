# Gurukul - Next.js Migration Complete ðŸŽ‰

Your tutoring platform has been successfully converted from React/Vite to Next.js App Router!

## How to Run the Application

### Development
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Production
```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

## Project Structure

```
app/
â”œâ”€â”€ layout.tsx          # Root layout with navigation & auth
â”œâ”€â”€ page.tsx           # Home page (/)
â”œâ”€â”€ auth/page.tsx      # Authentication (/auth)
â”œâ”€â”€ courses/page.tsx   # Courses listing (/courses)
â””â”€â”€ dashboard/
    â”œâ”€â”€ layout.tsx     # Dashboard layout with auth protection
    â”œâ”€â”€ student/page.tsx    # Student dashboard
    â”œâ”€â”€ instructor/page.tsx # Instructor dashboard
    â”œâ”€â”€ parent/page.tsx     # Parent dashboard
    â””â”€â”€ admin/page.tsx      # Admin dashboard
```

## Key Features

âœ… **File-based Routing**: Clean URLs like `/courses`, `/dashboard/student`  
âœ… **Authentication Context**: Persistent login state across routes  
âœ… **Protected Routes**: Dashboard pages require authentication  
âœ… **SEO Optimized**: Each page has proper meta tags  
âœ… **Responsive Design**: Works on all devices  
âœ… **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support  

## Authentication Flow

1. Users sign in at `/auth`
2. Based on user type, they're redirected to appropriate dashboard
3. Authentication state persists across page refreshes
4. Protected routes automatically redirect to `/auth` if not logged in

## Next Steps for Deployment

1. **Vercel** (Recommended): Connect your GitHub repo
2. **Netlify**: Deploy with build command `npm run build`
3. **Self-hosted**: Use `npm run build && npm run start`

## Environment Variables (for production)

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
```

## Migration Notes

- âœ… Converted from client-side routing to Next.js App Router
- âœ… Moved authentication to React Context with persistence
- âœ… Added proper meta tags and SEO optimization
- âœ… Maintained all existing functionality
- âœ… Improved performance with server-side rendering
- âœ… Added route protection for dashboard pages

The old `App.tsx` has been backed up as `App_backup.tsx` for reference.
